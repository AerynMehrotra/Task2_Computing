      The majority of online cookbook websites lack individuality and mostly appeal to an older audience—mainly adults.<br><br>
      They’re all very similar in design and feel, and the recipes they contain are often unhealthy, overly complicated, and take too much time to make.<br><br>
      There’s a dire need for a website that focuses on recipes that are healthy, easy to make, and accessible for everyone—no matter their age, cooking experience, or how much time they have.<br><br>
      It would make cooking more enjoyable again, turning it back into what it used to be: something people did for quality time, as a hobby, or as a form of self-expression.<br><br>
      A site like that would stand out by being more inclusive, modern, and catering to a wider range of people.
